- After using the bot, you can delete the repository from your computer

⚠️ **During Execution**:
- Keep the browser window visible
- Don't interrupt the process

## 🎯 How It Works

1. Bot enters your credentials automatically.
2. Bot pauses for **Manual Captcha Step**:
   - Solve the captcha in the browser window.
   - Click the **LOGIN** button in the browser.
   - Once the dashboard loads, go back to the terminal and press **ENTER**.
3. Navigates to feedback sections
4. Fills forms based on your `.env` configuration
5. Automatically detects already submitted feedback and skips them
6. Provides detailed summary of all actions

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Bot fails to login:**
- Check your enrollment number and password
- Ensure you have internet connection
- Check for errors in logs

**Subject/Teacher not found:**
- Verify spelling in `.env` matches exactly with SMS portal
- Check for extra spaces

**Browser closes immediately:**
- Check console for error messages
- Ensure all required fields in `.env` are filled
